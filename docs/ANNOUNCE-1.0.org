* Training mode improvements

  The algorithms for the recognition and speed training modes have
  been improved to more provide a better learning path.

  + A new set of training sequences for learning "similar" sounding
    character sequences (eg, "e, i, s, h, and 5").
  + The speed mode, in particular, now contains a carefully crafted
    rate increase to gradually increase the rate of speed.
  + A slight (configurable) delay has been introduced in recognition
    training to allow a time break before the next sound is played.
