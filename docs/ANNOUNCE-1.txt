  + A new set of training sequences for learning "similar" sounding
    character sequences (eg, "e, i, s, h, and 5").
  + The speed mode, in particular, now contains a carefully crafted
    rate increase to gradually increase the rate of speed.

    training to allow a time break before the next sound is played.
