* Version: 0.5.1
*** DONE A makerelease packaging script.
* Version: 0.5
*** DONE Use programmed screens instead of qtdesigner screens to get around maemo bugs
*** DONE Rewrite the letter training mode to be purely based on percentage and not time
*** DONE Add a graph widget to indicate training progress
*** DONE improve the probability for bad letters in recognition mode
***** Example case with L good letters and 1 bad one:
      + P = percent correct of the "bad" letter (eg, 50)
      + L = # of letters at O%
      + O = percent correct of the good letter (eg, 100)
      + T = target probability (eg, .5)
      + N = magic constant

***** probability calculation:
      t=(n-p)/(l*n-lo+n-p)

***** solved for N
      n = ((p+lo)*t-p)/((l+1)*t-1) 

      Note: fails at l = 1 with inf/inf

***** Values for N given L

***** Plotting the probability graph with gnuplot

      plot [0:100] f(p)=(n-p)/((l*n-l*o) + n - p), n=102, l=26, o=100, f(x)

      change the top percent:

      plot [0:100] f(p)=(n-p)/((l*n-l*o) + n - p), n=102, l=26, o=100, f(x) title "100", o=90, f(x) title "90", o=80, f(x) title "80", o=70, f(x) title "70"
*** DONE Fix the probability in speed training mode
*** DONE create a home screen and a home screen button
*** DONE fix trailing sound sometimes cut off on linux
*** DONE Make the progress bars draw a level indicator on top for:
    - [X] The needed training level
*** DONE make the home screen use QGroupBoxes
*** DONE help should be scrollable and also stacked on maemo
*** DONE color code letters in sequence graph according to current
