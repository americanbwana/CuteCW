Cute CW: train yourself

* Introduction

  I've had thoughts for a long time about how we train ourselves in CW
  ("Carrier Wave" otherwise known as Morse Code).  After preparing for a
  presentation about learning CW I realized software could really help
  us out in ways not yet seen.  This is my effort to help decrease the
  pain in training your brain to understand Morse Code.
